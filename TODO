Todo list (needs to be updated)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 - improve documentation
 - configurable smart indentation like in C/JAVA/PERL/REXX modes for any mode
 - fully support clipboard in every prompt
 - BlockPasteOver.
 - draw mode
 - piping block to program, redirection of program output to buffer
 - hex mode editing
 - shell window support
 - Menus should determine keybindings automatically.
 - CVS/RCS support.
 - Regexp optimizer and improved regexps.
 - multiple frame support for gui version.
 - Win32 gui version.

Here are some more:
 - command to center the lines in block (BlockCenter) 
 - command to wrap entire paragraph
 - commands to load/close desktop
 - remove all modal states (when getting input) (needed for kbd macros and multiframe).
 - fix win95 compiler execution
 - OS2: see if we can avoid clipserv under OS/2 using Ilya's fake-PM trick.
 - make configuration editor in Java (support only subset of config files?)
 - see if we could use java as the macro language
 - X11: set icons for X11
 - X11: set WM_COMMAND
 - Linux: make it run on tty.
 - Linux: fix the console version (capslock, numlock, ...)

Comments and suggestions are appreciated!
